# Matlab_Simulink_BoostConverter
I did a DC-DC BOOST CONVERTER from 12V to 36V, 100W-200W with filter Capasitor. 
First of all I calculated resistor according to power then inductor, output capasite, input capasite, duty cycle and diode. After that I calculated them with tolerance for createing them in real world. After ı decided to value of component, ı simulated them in MATLAB.
